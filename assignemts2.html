What is a Network?<br>
A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs),<br> exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables,<br> telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.<br>

Two very common types of networks include:<br>

Local Area Network (LAN)<br>
Wide Area Network (WAN)<br>Local Area Network
A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that is confined to a relatively small area.<br> It is generally limited to a geographic area such as a writing lab, school, or building.<br>

Computers connected to a network are broadly categorized as servers or workstations.<br> Servers are generally not used by humans directly, but rather run continuously to provide <br>"services" to the other computers (and their human users) on the network. Services provided can include printing and faxing,<br> software hosting, file storage and sharing, messaging, data storage and retrieval, complete access control (security) for the network's <br>resources, and many others.

Workstations are called such because they typically<br> do have a human user which interacts with the network through them. Workstations were traditionally considered a<br> desktop, consisting of a computer, keyboard, display, and mouse, or a laptop, with with integrated keyboard, display, and touchpad. With<br> the advent of the tablet computer, and the touch screen devices such as iPad and iPhone, our definition of workstation is quickly evolving <br>to include those devices, because of their ability to interact with the network and utilize network services.<br>
